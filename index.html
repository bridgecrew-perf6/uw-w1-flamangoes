			<h2>Some Beasts</h2>
			<p>It was the twilight of the iguana:</p>

			<p>From a rainbowing battlement, <br>
			a tongue like a javelin <br>
			lunging in verdure; <br>
			an ant heap treading the jungle, <br>
			monastic, on musical feet; <br>
			the guanaco, oxygen-fine <br>
			in the high places swarthed with distances, <br>
			cobbling his feet into gold; <br>
			the llama of scrupulous eye <br>
			the widens his gaze on the dews <br>
			of a delicate world.</p>

			<p>A monkey is weaving <br>
			a thread of insatiable lusts <br>
			on the margins of morning: <br>
			he topples a pollen-fall, <br>
			startles the violet-flght <br>
			of the butterfly, wings on the Muzo.</p>

			<p>It was the night of the alligator: <br>
			snouts moving out of the slime, <br>
			in original darkness, the pullulations, <br>
			a clatter of armour, opaque <br>
			in the sleep of the bog, <br>
			turning back to the chalk of the sources.</p>

			<p>The jaguar touches the leaves <br>
			with his phosphorous absence, <br>
			the puma speeds to his covert <br>
			in the blaze of his hungers, <br>
			his eyeballs, a jungle of alcohol, <br>
			burn in his head.</p>
